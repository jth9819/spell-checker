# About the Project
This program was written for a project in my Advanced Computer Programming Course in my Fall 2021 semester. This project focusses heavily on reading and writing from/to files. The purpose of this program is to type into a text area, check it against the dictionary file, and offer suggested words if the text area contains mispelled words. 

# Installation and Execution
* Clone repo to local machine
* Import project in Eclipse as "Existing Maven Projects" under Maven
* **Run App.java** (harrisonj -> src/main/java -> uwf.harrisonj -> App.java)
